<h1 align="left">Hello World! 👋 My name is Gale Gamboa</h1>

<h2 align="left">About me</h2>
Senior Data Technologist (Business Intelligence Analyst/Database Developer)

###

<p align="left"> I thought I made a mistake when, in the summer of my 6th-grade year, I complained to my engineer father that I was bored.   School was out, so I fully expected to regret my comment, bracing myself for what I thought would be a long list of chores to help reframe my unappreciated downtime.   Instead, he left the house and came back with an IBM PC (this was the 80s, and that was cutting-edge tech), and a book titled BASIC: Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code.   He told me to read it, build something, and then by the end of the summer, write a report or tell him what I learned.   It turns out that statement wasn’t the misguided musings of a kid declaring summer-break tedium.   What followed was the inauguration to a world defined by creativity and innovation and would eventually set me on the path to my career in data analytics …</p>

<p align="left">✨ CREED: "Without data, you're just another person with an opinion."<br>
  <br>📚 I'm CURRENTLY LEARNING:  PYTHON (and eventually want to learn how to play the guitar and juggle)<br>
  <br>🎯 GOALS:<br>In a Parallel Universe - To make an unknown discovery and major paleontological find by digging in dirt and have a dinosaur named after me<br> In Our Universe - To make unknown discoveries and contribute business insights by digging into data and ultimately enhance productivity<br>
  <br>🎲 FUN FACT: ...I landed my first job by sending the CEO a random email. Ok, truth is, it was my Dad and he told me to stop goofing around and finish my homework. And be ready to go to the print shop in the morning for my first day.</p>
